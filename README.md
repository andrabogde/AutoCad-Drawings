# 🏗️ AutoCAD Drawings – University Projects

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of **AutoCAD drawings** created during my undergraduate studies at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science – Ovidius University**.  
These works were part of various coursework and practical assignments where I explored technical design, precision modeling, and architectural drafting.

---

## 📂 Included Drawings
- **`table.dwg`** – 2D technical drawing of a table, focusing on precise dimensions and professional drafting techniques.
- **`1.dwg`** – Engineering/architectural sketch emphasizing geometric accuracy and layer management.
- **`2.dwg`** – Additional AutoCAD practice drawing showcasing use of blocks, hatching, and annotations.
